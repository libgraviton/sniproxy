# sni-proxy

Very lean dynamic ingress traffic router based on alpine linux and inbound rules based URI and Port rewriting.

## Scope
This service discovery is based on docker embedded dns and solving multiple requirements:
- Port overlapping on HTTP and TCP (eg. SNI on TLS)
- End to end encryption with TLS passthrough
- Always up to date when further containers are spinned up or removed

## Warning
This library consumes ways more CPU then haproxy. An alternative go-library is at work.
